# CMPE 255 Data Mining: Assignment 3: Finding Approximate Nearest Neighbor using state of art libraries.

### Following _Approximate Nearest Neighbor search_ algorithms are implemented in the Colab notebook added to the github repository.

1. LSH
2. Exhaustive Search
3. Product Quantization
4. Tree and graph
5. HNSW

### The state of art Libraries used for implementing these algorithms are:
1. [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)
2. [NMSLIB](https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib)

### Data Set used
The Dataset used is Movielens from the Light FM

### Problem Statement
Finding the similar vectors on movie lens dataset using various Approximate Nearest neighbor algorithms.
